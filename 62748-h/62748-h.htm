<p>To those who know Miss Maud Lindsay's stories
for little children,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a new collection needs no heralding.
She has proved herself gifted with loving insight,
literary ability, and spiritual power. Her
stories, whether told in kindergarten, school, or Sunday-school,
or perused by little readers, have charmed
children and touched their hearts.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> "Mother Stories" and "More Mother Stories."</p></div>

<p>The stories in "A Story Garden" are addressed,
in the main, to the nursery public&mdash;a public in pinafore
and rompers,&mdash;to the very youngest listeners.
Any one who uses them with little children, whether
realizing or not the art required for such writing, will
find the stories wonderful in their fitness and enduring
interest. Repetition only endears them to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">« vi »</a></span>
listening child, for, unlike many "simple" stories,
which are merely pretty little nothings, Miss Lindsay's
have point and truth that the young child can
understand.</p>

<p>To invite little children and their retinue of loving
attendants to enter "A Story Garden" and enjoy its
fair blossoms and wholesome fruit, is a privilege of
which I gladly avail myself, because I can unqualifiedly
commend Miss Lindsay's stories as the very
best I know of for little children. They are by far
the best literary product (of their kind) that can be
traced to the kindergarten or to the new understanding
of childhood that marks our time. Trust them.
Use them. They will give joy, refine the taste, enrich
the imagination, and gently impel the child toward
the True, the Beautiful, and the Good.</p>

<p>Children delight in folk-tale and fairy lore, but the
very little child loves best the story which mirrors the
familiar. And it is for him, and for the mother who is
striving in this age of profusion to guard the innate
simplicity of her child's nature, that I have written
my little stories.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time, early in the morning when
the sun was just climbing over the hills and
all the clouds were rosy pink, a little child lay
asleep in his pretty white bed.</p>

<p>"Wake up, wake up," ticked the clock that stood
on the mantel. "Wake up, wake up;" but the child
did not hear a word that it said.</p>

<p>"I'll wake him up," said a bird that lived in a tree
close by the window. "He throws me crumbs to eat
every day, and I will wake him with a song." So the
bird sat in the tree and sang and sang, "Wake up,
dearie, dearie, dearie," till all the birds in the garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
waked up and sang with her; but the little child slept
on in his pretty white bed.</p>

<p>He was still asleep when the wind from the South
blew through the garden. "I know this little child,"
said the wind. "I turned his windmill for him yesterday,
and I will blow through the window and wake
him with a kiss." So the wind blew through the window
and kissed him on both cheeks, and blew his
curls about his face; but the child did not stir in his
pretty white bed.</p>

<p>"He is waiting for me to call him," said the rooster
in the barnyard. "Nobody knows him so well as I,
for I belong to him, and I will wake him." So the
rooster stood on the fence and flapped his wings, and
crowed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Cock, cock a doo,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'm calling you.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wake up, wake up,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cock, cock a doo."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span></p>
<p>He waked the yellow chickens and the old hen, the
pigeons in the pigeon-house, and the little red calf in
the barn. Even the lambs in the meadow heard his
call; but he did not wake the little child, though he
crowed till he was hoarse.</p>

<p>Now by this time the sun was bright in the sky.
It shone over the hills and the meadows. It shone
in the barnyard where the noisy rooster crowed and
in the garden where the birds sang, and it shone
through the window right into the little child's face.
<i>And then the little child opened his eyes!</i> "Mamma,
Mamma," he called; and his mamma came in at once
to dress him. "Who waked my baby child?" asked
she; but nobody answered, for not even little Sleepy
Head himself knew that it was the sun.</p>

did not want to go to bed.</p>

<p>"The yellow chickens are all asleep," said
his mother, as she undressed him. "I heard the old
hen calling them, cluck, cluck, cluck, before you had
eaten your supper."</p>

<p>"But I do not want to go to sleep," said the child.</p>

<p>"The pigeons are all asleep," said his mother, "up

they said, then tucked their heads under their wings."</p>

<p>"But I do not want to go to sleep," said the child.</p>

<p>It was a soft downy bed close beside a window, but
the child did not want to lie there. He tossed about
under the coverlet, and the tears were beginning to
run down his cheeks when, all at once, the moon
looked in at the window.</p>

<p>"There!" said his mother. "The moon has come
to tell you good-night. See how it is smiling."</p>

<p>The moon shone right into the child's eyes.
"Good night, little child, sleep well," it seemed to
say.</p>

<p>"Good night," said he; and he lay still on his bed,

<h2><a name="THE_WINDS_FUN" id="THE_WINDS_FUN">THE WIND'S FUN</a></h2>


<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>ne day the wind blew through the town, and
oh, how merry it was! It whistled down the
chimneys, and scampered round the corners,
and sang in the tree tops. "Come and dance, come
and dance, come and dance with me," that is what it
seemed to say.</p>

<p>And what could keep from dancing to such a merry
tune? The clothes danced on the clothes-line, the
leaves danced on the branches of the trees, a bit of
paper danced about the street, and a little boy's hat
danced off of his head and down the sidewalk as fast
as it could go.</p>

<p>It was a sailor hat with a blue ribbon around it;
and the ends of the ribbons flew out behind like little
blue flags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the little boy as it blew away; but
the hat could not stop. The wind whirled it and
twirled it, and landed it at last right in the middle of
the street.</p>

<p>"Now I'll get it," said the child, and he was just
reaching his hand out for it when off it went again,
rolling over and over like a hoop.</p>

<p>"Nobody can catch me," thought the hat proudly;
"and I do not know myself how far I shall go."</p>

<p>Just then the wind whisked it into an alley, and
dropped it behind a barrel there. When the little boy
looked into the alley, it was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Where is my new sailor hat?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! I know," laughed the wind, and it blew
behind the barrel, and fluttered the ends of the blue
ribbon till the little boy spied them.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said he; and he ran to pick up the hat
in a hurry.</p>

<p>"The wind shall not get my new hat again," he
said; and he put it on his head and held it with both
hands all the way home.</p>

they danced on and on, till the wind blew away; and
that is the end of the story.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BROWN_BIRDS" id="THE_BROWN_BIRDS">THE BROWN BIRDS</a></h2>


<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>ne fair spring morning two bonny brown
birds sat on a lilac bush twittering and chirping:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Chee, chee, cheeree. Where shall we make our
little nest?"</p>

<p>"Make it here in my branches," said the maple tree
that grew by the garden gate. "Many a nest have I
held in my arms. Make it here."</p>

<p>The maple tree was strong and green and beautiful.
Its wide-spreading branches reached from the garden
path far over the road beyond the gate; and they
rocked like a cradle in the wind that fair spring morning.
Oh! it was the very place to make a nest, and as
soon as the brown birds had looked at it they decided
to build there.</p>

<p>"Chee, chee, cheeree," they sang in the sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"We'll make our nest in the maple tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! we are so happy, chee, chee, cheeree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They twittered and chirped and trilled and sang
till a cow, that was eating her breakfast of hay in the
barnyard near by, put her head over the fence to ask
the news. When the brown birds told her what they
were going to do she did not wonder at their singing.</p>

<p>"If you need any hay," said she, "fly over the
fence and help yourselves to some of mine. There is
plenty here for you and me; and I have heard my
friend the speckled hen say that there is nothing better
for a nest than hay."</p>

<p>"Very true," said the maple tree. "Every bird
must suit himself, but I agree with the speckled hen,
and I have held enough nests to know something
about them."</p>

<p>The brown birds looked at each other wisely.</p>

<p>"Chee, chee, cheeree," they sang again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"We'll weave <i>our</i> little nest of hay;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Oh! we are so happy, chee, chee, cheeree,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>sang the birds as they hurried into the barnyard.</p>

<p>They could take only a little hay at a time in their
bills, but they chose the nicest, longest pieces they
could find, and were just ready to fly away with them
when a horse came galloping up.</p>

<p>"This is no way to carry hay," he cried. "Tell me
where you live, and I will bring it to your barn in a
wagon."</p>

<p>Then the two birds laughed till they dropped the
hay from their bills; the cow laughed till her bell
tinkled; the maple tree laughed till its leaves shook;
and the horse laughed, too, though he did not know
what the joke was, till the cow told him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well," he said to the birds, "if I cannot haul
your hay for you, perhaps I may give you some hairs
from my mane for your nest. I am sure I can't see
what use they can be, but a bird in the pasture begged
for some, and she said she was building a nest in the
hedge."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Chee, chee, cheeree. 'T is nice to line<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And we are so happy, chee, chee, cheeree,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>chirped the birds.</p>

<p>By this time everybody in the barnyard knew that
two brown birds were making a nest in the maple tree
by the garden gate; and everybody wanted to help
them.</p>

<p>"Take this with my love," called the pigeon; and
she dropped a feather from her soft white breast, as
she flew from the pigeon house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span></p>

<p>"We, too, have feathers to spare," cried the hen
and the goose.</p>

<p>"Every nest is the better for a bit of down," said
the duck. "And I can give that."</p>

<p>The two birds were pleased with everything.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Chee, chee, chee, chee, cheeree," sang they,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"With feathers soft, and hair, and hay,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Up in the dear old maple tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! we are so happy, chee, chee, cheeree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They were busy all the fair spring morning carrying
the gifts to the maple tree; and as they flew back
and forth a little girl spied them, and called to her
mother:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, come and see these little birds with
feathers and hay in their bills. What are they doing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span></p>

<p>"I know," said her mother. "They are building
a nest in our maple tree. Would you like to give
them a piece of cloth like your new pink dress for
their nest?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes," said the child; and she ran and got
the cloth from the scrap bag, and hung it on the lilac
bush. It had not been there longer than a minute
when down flew a brown bird to get it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Chee, chee," he sang, "what do you think?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I've found a lovely bit of pink<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To trim our nest up in the tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! I am so happy, chee, chee, cheeree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Just what we needed," said the other brown bird;
and she made haste to weave it into the nest, for there
was no time to waste.</p>

<p>Over and under, in and out, twisting and pulling,
they wove the cloth and the hay together, with a
lining of hair and downy feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span></p>

<p>The nest was finished by the time the little girl's
papa came home to dinner, and he held her up in his
arms to see it.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I gave them a piece like my new dress,"
she said, when she spied the bit of pink woven into
the nest.</p>

<p>"Chee, chee, so are we," sang the brown birds in
the tree top.</p>

<div class="dropcap">T</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>here was once a little boy who was too tired
to walk; or at least he thought he was. He
and his mother and the baby were at his
grandmother's house and it was time to go home, but
he sat down on the doorstone and felt very sure that
he could not go a step farther.</p>

<p>"Somebody will have to carry me," he said.</p>

<p>"Well," said his mother, who had the baby in her
arms, "what shall we do?"</p>

<p>And I am sure I do not know what they would have
done if the little boy's grandmother had not come out
just then to see what the matter was.</p>

<p>"If he cannot walk he must ride," she said; and
she went into the house and got the old hearth broom,
and the mop handle, and one of Grandfather's walking-sticks
and brought them all out to the little boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," said she, "will you ride a slow and steady
gray horse, or a sleek-as-satin bay horse, or will you
ride a black horse that is spirited and gay?"</p>

<p>"I like black horses best," said the little boy; "and
I will ride that one, please."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Grandmother; and she took
Grandfather's walking-stick and gave it to the little
boy. "This is a very fast horse," she said. "I
should not be surprised if you got home before your
mother and the baby; but do be careful."</p>

<p>"I will," promised the little boy; and away he rode
on the stick horse, gallop, gallop, gallop!</p>

<p>By the time Mother and the baby came out of
Grandmother's gate the little boy was at the corner.
When they reached the corner he had passed the big
elm tree that grew by the sidewalk. When he rode
up the little hill beyond the elm, trot, trot, trot, they
almost caught up with him; but when they went
down on the other side he was far ahead.</p>

boy knew it himself he was at home; and when
Mother and the baby got there the stick horse was
hitched to the red rose bush, and the little boy sat on
the doorstep laughing.</p>

<p>"I got home first. I got home first. I can ride fast
on my black horse," said the little boy.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time there was a clock that stood
on the mantel in a little boy's mother's room,
ticking merrily night and day, "Tickity,
tickity tock." It told the little boy's father when to
go to work and his mother when to get dinner, and
sometimes it talked to the little boy himself. "Go to
bed, Sleepy Head," that is what it seemed to say at
bedtime; and in the morning it ticked out loud and
clear, as if it were calling, "Wake up! wake up! wake
up!"</p>

<p>The little boy's mother always knew just what it
meant by its tickity, tickity tock, and late one afternoon,
when he was playing with his toys and the clock
was ticking on the mantel, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen, little boy, the clock has something to tell
you:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i2">You must be ready to welcome him here.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the little boy jumped up in a hurry and put
his hobby-horse in the corner and his pony lines on a
hook in the closet and his tin soldiers in a straight
row on the cupboard shelf.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready," he said, but:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the little boy, when his mother told
him this; but he stood very still while she washed his
hands and his rosy face and combed his curls till they
were smooth and shining.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready," he cried, but Mother said:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then she made haste to get the blouse out of the
dresser drawer, where it had been ever since it was
finished. It had a big collar and a tie, and when the
little boy put it on he looked like a sailor man.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready," he said, and&mdash;do you believe
it?&mdash;the very next minute the door opened and in
walked the little boy's father.</p>

saucer pie is one that is baked in a saucer instead

<p>"I think you will have to borrow Grandmother's

biscuit cutter! Was there ever anything so funny
as that? Polly laughed about it all the way upstairs
to Grandmother's room; but when she told Grandmother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
what she wanted, Grandmother did not think
it was strange at all.</p>

<p>"I used to make thimble biscuit when I was a little
girl," she said; and she made haste to get the thimble
out of her workbag for Polly.</p>

<p>Grandmother's thimble was made of shining gold;
and oh, what a fine biscuit cutter it made! The biscuit
were as small and as round as buttons, and Polly
cut enough for Grandmother, and Papa, and Mamma,
and Brother Ned, and herself, each to have one for
supper that night.</p>

<p>"I think it is fun to make thimble biscuit," she said
as she handed them around in her own blue saucer;
and if you don't believe she was right, make some
yourself, and see.</p>

<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time there was a strawberry
shortcake, all juicy and sweet and pleasant
to eat.</p>

<p>A little boy named Ben picked the berries for it.
He went out to the field where the wild strawberries
grew, all by himself; and when he came home he had
a bucket full of the very ripest and reddest ones.</p>

<p>A little girl, Cousin Pen, who was visiting on the
farm, capped the berries, and that was not nearly so
easy to do as it sounds. It took Cousin Pen every bit
of a half-hour to do it, and&mdash;do you believe it?&mdash;she
did not eat a single berry. She saved every one
of them for the strawberry shortcake.</p>

<p>Mamma made the shortcake. She was the best
cook! If I should try to tell you all the good things
she could make, it would take me longer than it took
Cousin Pen to cap the berries; but I will tell you this,
if there was one thing she liked to make better than
another it was a strawberry shortcake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span></p>

<p>A big boy almost nine years old, whom every one
called Brother Fred, cut the wood, and split the kindling,
and made the fire that baked the pastry for the
strawberry shortcake. He had a little axe of his own,
and the way he could make chips fly was simply astonishing.
Mamma said if he kept on as he had begun
he would be as much help as his papa when he
grew up.</p>

<p>Papa was away at work when the shortcake was
made, and when he came home to dinner nobody said
a word about it. They did not even tell him there
was a dessert. They just sat down and ate their dinner
as if there were not a strawberry shortcake in the
world, much less one in their own kitchen. It was the
funniest thing! Papa did not know anything about
it; but by and by he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Wild strawberries are ripe. Who wants to go
and get some for a shortcake?"</p>

<p>And then how the children did laugh! They
laughed and laughed until Mamma knew they could
not keep the secret another minute.</p>

<p>"Shut your eyes, Papa, and don't open them until
we call 'ready,'" she said, and she slipped out into
the kitchen and got the strawberry shortcake, and
put it on the table right in front of him.</p>

<p>"Ready," called Cousin Pen and Brother Fred and
little Ben. "Ready."</p>

<p>And if you could have seen how surprised Papa
was when he opened his eyes and spied that strawberry
shortcake, you would have laughed as much as
they did.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>ne morning little boy Ben came home from
the pasture, where he had taken the cows,
with so much to tell that he could not wait
until he got to the house to begin.</p>

<p>"The wild grapes are ripe, the persimmons are
sweet, and the chestnuts are falling out of the burrs.
One dropped on my hat when I came through the
wood; and I saw a little gray squirrel eating nuts,"
he called to Brother Fred as soon as he reached the
big gate.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Brother Fred. "We can go and
get some this very afternoon;" and when he went to
take some corn to the mill for his father, he stopped
at his Cousin Pen's house to tell her about it.</p>

<p>"The wild grapes are ripe, the persimmons are
sweet, and the chestnuts are falling out of the burrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
We are going to get some this afternoon. Don't you
want to go, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Cousin Pen; "and I will bring
Mary Sue with me."</p>

<p>Mary Sue was Cousin Pen's little friend; and as
soon as Brother Fred had gone, Cousin Pen ran over
to her house.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary Sue!" she cried. "What do you think?
The wild grapes are ripe, the persimmons are sweet,
the chestnuts are falling out of the burrs, and my
Cousin Fred wants us to go to the woods to get some
this very day."</p>

<p>"How nice," said Mary Sue; "let's go and tell
Dan."</p>

<p>Dan was Mary Sue's neighbor. He lived next door
to her; and he let Cousin Pen and her ride on his
pony sometimes. He was in the barn feeding the
pony when the girls went to his house; and they ran
through the yard to find him.</p>

<p>"And the chestnuts are falling out of the burrs.
Don't you want to go and get some?" asked Mary
Sue.</p>

<p>"I'll go if Larry Brown will," said Dan; and he
climbed up on a ladder and put his head out of the
barn window, and called as loud as he could:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Larry, Larry, don't you want to go to the woods
to get some grapes and persimmons and chestnuts?
I'll go if you will."</p>

<p>Larry came running across the street from his
house in a hurry to see what was the matter. He was
as pleased as all the rest had been to hear the good
news; and when he went home he told his little sister
Nan about it.</p>

<p>"The wild grapes are ripe, the persimmons are
sweet, the chestnuts are falling out of the burrs, and
I am going to bring you some," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span></p>

<p>But little Nan wanted to go, too. "I will carry her
if she gets tired," said Larry; so after they had eaten
their dinner, Mother gave Nan a little basket, and
she started out, holding Larry's hand.</p>

<p>The others were ready and waiting; and away they
all went to the pleasant wood.</p>

where they all might see, sat the little gray squirrel!</p>

<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time there was a grandmother
who went to spend Thanksgiving day with
her children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>She had three grandchildren, Isabel, Jack, and
Jamie, and as soon as she had taken off her cloak and
bonnet she sat down in Mamma's big rocking-chair,
and called them to her.</p>

<p>"I have a present for each one of you in my brown
bag," she said, "but before I give them to you, you
must guess what they are."</p>

<p>"Oh, Grandma!" said Isabel and Jack and Jamie;
and they watched her with wondering eyes as she
opened the bag, and took out a bundle.</p>

<p>"Jamie's present is in this bundle," said she. "It
is red on the outside, and white on the inside and in
the middle there is something brown."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I know what it is," said Jack.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Isabel; but Grandma would not let
them guess.</p>

<p>"Jamie must guess it himself," she said. So Jamie
guessed a ball, and a flower and a piece of candy and
everything else he could think of; but he could not
guess what was in the bundle till Grandma let him
smell it. Then he knew.</p>

<p>"An apple, a red apple," he cried; and when he
opened the bundle, there, sure enough, was a big,
round apple. It was red on the outside, and white on
the inside; and when he had eaten it he found in the
middle, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven brown
seeds.</p>

<p>The next bundle was for Jack. Grandma shook it
up and down, and something rattled inside.</p>

<p>"Marbles," guessed Jack; but Grandma shook her
head.</p>

<p>"Listen to this," she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nuts, nuts!" cried Jack. "Hickory nuts from
the big hickory tree that grows in your front yard."
And he was right, too.</p>

<p>"Now it is my turn," said Isabel; "and I am going
to try to guess my present with my very first guess."</p>

<p>But when Grandma took out a little bundle
wrapped in tissue paper, and put it into Isabel's
hands, she was as puzzled as the others had been.</p>

<p>"Be very careful," said Grandma; "for if you break
your present you will never be able to mend it, no
matter how hard you try."</p>

<p>"May I ask questions about it?" asked Isabel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandma, "you may ask three questions;

my lips, and will not answer another one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span></p>

<p>"White," said Grandma.</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"The haystack," said Grandma.</p>

<p>"Who told you it was there?"</p>

<p>"<i>The old white hen</i>," said Grandma; and she
closed her lips just as she had said she would; but
Isabel knew what her present was without another
word.</p>

<p>"I knew as soon as you said it came from the haystack,"
she said. "It is an egg."</p>

<p>And so it was, a beautiful fresh white egg. Isabel
had it for her breakfast the very next morning.</p>

<p>"My!" said Grandma, as the children gathered
around her to kiss her and thank her. "What good
guessers my grandchildren are!"</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time when all the ground was
white with snow and all the roofs were
trimmed with icicles, a little boy went out
into the world to make snowballs.</p>

<p>His mother wrapped him up so nice and warm
from head to toe that you could scarcely see anything
of him but the tip of his nose; and when the snowbirds
that lived in his own front yard saw him, they
did not know him.</p>

<p>They flew away to the top of the fence, and cocked
their heads first on one side, and then on the other,
as if they were thinking, "Who can this be?" but by
and by they found out.</p>

<p>"Chirp, chirp," they said to each other. "It is
only the little boy who throws us crumbs from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
window;" and they flew down into the yard again
to watch him make snowballs.</p>

<p>The little boy knew just how to make snowballs,
and how to throw them, too, for he had seen his big
cousin do it. First he took a handful of snow, and
then he packed it in his hands like this; and then
hurrah! he threw it as far as he could send it.</p>

<p>One of his snowballs went into the corner of the
yard and one against a tree, and one all the way over
the fence into the street. It was great fun to play in
the snow, and the little boy was sorry when the maid
called from the house to tell him it was time to come
in.</p>

<p>"As soon as I make one more," he answered; and
he took a great handful of snow, and made such a big
snowball that he thought he must take it into the
house to show to his mother.</p>

<p>Now the little boy's mother had gone to market
while he was playing in the snow; but he took the
snowball into her room, and put it on the hearth so
that she might see it when she came home.</p>

<p>There was a bright fire burning in the grate, and it
sounded just as if it were laughing, with its cricklety
cracklety, cricklety cracklety, when the little boy put
the snowball down in front of it.</p>

<p>"Oh! what a nice big fire," he said; and he
climbed up into the rocking chair close beside it to
wait for his mother.</p>

<p>"Rockity rock, rockity rock," said the rocking
chair.</p>

<p>"Cricklety, cracklety," laughed the fire; and the
little boy was so comfortable and so warm that he
went fast asleep on the cushions.</p>

<p>When he waked up his mother was still away at
the market; and the fire was still laughing, louder
than ever.</p>

<p>"Cricklety cracklety, cricklety cracklety;" but
when he looked on the hearth for his snowball it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
gone! There was nothing there at all but a little pool
of water.</p>

<p>The little boy looked under the chair and under the
bed and under the dresser, behind the door and in all
the corners; upstairs and downstairs, high and low;
but he could not find the snowball anywhere.</p>

<p>And what do you think had become of it? The
little boy's mother guessed as soon as she came home;
and if you will ask your mother I am sure she will
tell you.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">E</span>very year, on the night before Christmas,
Santa Claus comes.</p>

<p>He rides in a sleigh drawn by tiny reindeer
with bells on their harnesses.</p>

<p>Tinkle, tinkle, ring the bells, and trit-trot, go the
little deer to carry Santa Claus over the world.</p>

<p>Santa Claus dresses in fur from his head to his
heels. His leggings are fur, his coat is fur, and he
wears a fur cap pulled down over his ears, for the
winds of the winter are icy cold.</p>

<p>O-o-o-o, sing the winds, tink, tinkle, ring the bells,
and trit-trot, go the little deer when Santa Claus rides
over the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span></p>

<p>Santa Claus's beard is as white as the snow, and
his cheeks are as red as apples, and his eyes are as
bright as the twinkling stars that look from the sky
to see him ride.</p>

<p>Twinkle, twinkle, shine the stars, O-o-o-o, sing the
winds, tink, tinkle, ring the bells, and trit-trot, go the
little deer when Santa Claus rides over the world.</p>

<p>Santa Claus is old, old as the hills, but he is strong
as a giant, and on his back he carries a pack, and the
pack is full of toys. He has dolls and drums, and
balls and tops, wagons and sleds, tea sets with blue
roses painted on them, and horns with red and white
stripes; and all of them are for little children. As
soon as the children are asleep on Christmas Eve,
Santa Claus comes to fill their stockings with good
things and give them beautiful gifts. He knows just
what the children want, every one of them, and he
laughs for joy as he rides away.</p>

Santa Claus rides over the world.</p>

<p>The children never see him come. No, indeed! If
he hears so much as a laugh or a whisper in the house
he stays outside till all is quiet. Why, once upon a
time there was a little boy who did not want to go to
bed on the night before Christmas. "I shall sit up
and see Santa Claus," he said. He hung his stocking
by the mantel, and sat in his mother's big rocking
chair and waited, and watched, and waited; but all
that he saw was a little gray mouse, though he stayed
awake till everybody but his mother was in bed, and
he could not keep his eyes open another minute. The
last thing he saw as he went to sleep was the stocking
hanging just where he had put it, and there was nothing
in it; but&mdash;do you believe it?&mdash;when he waked
up next morning it was full of goodies from tip to toe;
and right in front of the hearth was a wagon with red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
wheels! "Oh, oh! Santa Claus has been here," said
the little boy; and he clapped his hands, for he was
happy as could be.</p>

<p>All the world is happy when Santa Claus comes.
Trit-trot, go the little deer, tink, tinkle, ring the bells,
O-o-o-o, sing the winds, twinkle, twinkle, shine the

over the world to fill the children's stockings, and to
bring beautiful gifts.</p>

<h2><a name="TEN_PENNIES" id="TEN_PENNIES">TEN PENNIES</a></h2>


<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time there was a little boy who
went to buy some nails for his father, and
while he was waiting for the storekeeper to
wrap them up, he saw in the window a little red
hatchet.</p>

<p>"If I had a little red hatchet," thought the little
boy, "I could pound nails and split boards, and perhaps
I could build myself a little house," and he asked
the storekeeper the price of the hatchet.</p>

<p>"Just as many pennies as you have fingers on your
hands, or toes on your feet," said the man.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the little boy, and as soon as he went
out of the store he counted his fingers. "One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten." He
could not count his toes then, for he had on his shoes
and stockings, but he remembered to do it when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
undressed that night; and he had just as many toes
as he had fingers. The little red hatchet cost ten pennies.
"If I had ten pennies," he said to his mother,
"I know what I should do. I should buy me a little
red hatchet."</p>

<p>"How nice that would be," said his mother; "and
where would you get it?"</p>

<p>"From the storekeeper," said he; "and I could
pound nails and split boards and build houses. I wish
I had one."</p>

<p>"So do I," said his mother; "but now you must go
to sleep, for to-morrow is your birthday, and you will
want to be up with the sun."</p>

<p>The sun was up before the little boy, though, and
so was his mother. She was sitting on the bed when
he waked up, and on the table, close by the bed, were&mdash;what
do you think? Ten pennies, all in a row.</p>

<p>"Now you can buy the little red hatchet," said his
mother, giving him a birthday kiss.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 417px;">
<a id="fp56"></a><img src="images/fp56.png" width="417" height="483" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">TEN PENNIES.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, now I can buy the little red hatchet," said
the little boy; and he could scarcely wait to dress and
eat his breakfast before he started out to the store.
The ten pennies were in his pocket and they jingled
merrily as the little boy ran down the road. "Ten of
us are here! Ten of us are here!"&mdash;this is what
they seemed to say, and the boy laughed to hear them.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll cut down a tree with my little red
hatchet," he thought, as he ran.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning when he reached the
town, but the stores were open, and the men who sold
things on the street were already calling their wares.
One was a ragman. "Rags, rags!" he called. Another
was a pieman. He had his good things in a cart
that he pushed before him. There were fresh raspberry
tarts in his cart that day, and every now and
then he called:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tarts, tarts, raspberry tarts! A tart for a penny
and a penny for a tart. Tarts, tarts, raspberry tarts!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
A tart for a penny and a penny for a tart!" The
little boy stopped to listen. "Tarts, tarts, raspberry
tarts!" Oh, how delicious they looked&mdash;those
penny tarts in the pieman's cart!</p>

<p>"Will you have a tart, little master?" asked the
pieman.</p>

<p>The little boy put his hand in his pocket and drew
it out; then he put it back and drew it out again.
This time a penny came with it. "Yes, if you please,"
he said to the pieman. "I want a raspberry tart." A
nice, sweet, juicy three-cornered raspberry tart! The
little boy had eaten every crumb of it when he came
to the store where the little red hatchet lay in the
window.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw the hatchet he put his hand into
his pocket again and jingled his pennies. "One of us
is gone! One of us is gone!" said the pennies as
plainly as they could; but the little boy sat down on
the edge of the sidewalk and counted them. "One,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine." Then
he went into the store. The man who had told him
the price of the hatchet was not there, but a clerk
came to wait on him.</p>

<p>"Are there any nine-penny hatchets?" asked the
little boy.</p>

<p>"No," said the clerk; "all the little hatchets are
ten cents, and cheap at that. Would you like one to-day?"
But the little boy shook his head and went out
of the store. The pennies did not jingle in his pocket,
and his eyes were full of tears. He was just getting
his handkerchief out to wipe them away when he met
an old woman.</p>

<p>"Why are you crying, little boy?" asked she; and
her voice was so kind and her smile so pleasant that
the little boy told her all about it.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said she, when he had finished; "I
should not be surprised if you were the little boy for
whom I am looking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you looking for a little boy six years old?"
asked the child.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed," said the old woman; "and I
want him to pick up a pennyworth of chips for me."</p>

<p>When the little boy heard this he knew that he
must be the boy she wanted.</p>

<p>"I am six years old to-day," he said, "and I can
pick up chips. I pick them up for my mother, and
when I get my little red hatchet I am going to split
kindling for her, too."</p>

<p>Then the old woman led the way to her house and
gave the little boy a basket and showed him where
the woodpile was. The wood chopper had been there
with his sharp axe, and the chips were strewn about
the yard. The little boy set to work with a will, and
when he had filled the basket so full that not another
chip would stay in, he took it to the old woman.</p>

<p>"Is this a pennyworth of chips?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and good measure," answered the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
woman, and she took a bright new penny out of her
bag and gave it to the little boy. "Good-by, and
good fortune," she said; and the little boy wished
her the same before he ran through the gate toward
the town.</p>

<p>Oh, how swiftly his feet pattered down the road,
and, oh, how merrily the pennies jingled in his
pocket! "Ten of us again! Ten of us again!" This
is what they seemed to say now, and the little boy
laughed to hear them as he ran past the ragman with
his bag, past the pieman with his tarts, straight to
the store where the little red hatchet still lay in the
window.</p>

<p>"If you please, I want a little red hatchet," he said;
and he counted his pennies out on the counter, ten of
them in a row.</p>

<p>"Just as many pennies as you have fingers on your
hands, or toes on your feet," said the man, who had
come in to the store again; and he wrapped the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
red hatchet in a piece of brown paper and gave it to
the child.</p>

<p>It was a good little hatchet, and the little boy
pounded nails and split boards and cut his mother's
kindling with it; but whether he ever built a house
or cut down a tree I cannot tell you, for I do not know
myself.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LOST_DOLL" id="THE_LOST_DOLL">THE LOST DOLL</a></h2>


<div class="dropcap">T</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>here was once upon a time a little girl who
had a china doll named Jennie Bluebell.
Jennie Bluebell had black hair, and blue eyes,
and rosy cheeks, and a smiling mouth; and on her
feet were painted gilt slippers that shone like gold.</p>

<p>The little girl loved her more than she had ever
loved any other doll and wherever she went she
wanted Jennie Bluebell to go too. She took her to
walk in the lane, and to ride in the carriage, and one
day she carried her to a meadow where she and her
little brother went to pick golden-rod. She held her
in her arms all the way just as Mother held the baby
and when she got to the meadow she laid her down to
rest in the long meadow grass while she picked the
flowers. Meadow grass makes a beautiful soft bed for
a doll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span></p>

<p>"I will come back for you by and by," she said
as she left her there; but when it was time to go
home all the green grass looked alike to the little girl
and she could not tell where the dear doll lay.</p>

<p>"I put her right here, or at least I think I did. Oh,
where can she be?" she cried, as she hurried from
place to place parting the grasses with her hands and
peeping anxiously in. Her little brother searched,
too, but though they both looked till their mother
called to ask why they were staying so long, they had
to go home at last without the doll.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the fairies have taken her away," said
the little girl, who was almost crying.</p>

<p>"Or a rabbit," said the little boy; "Father saw
one in the field yesterday."</p>

<p>But neither fairies nor rabbits had touched Jennie
Bluebell. The tall grasses had swayed in the breezes
this way and that way till she was hidden from sight
but she had not moved from the spot where the little
girl had put her. All through the sunny afternoon
she lay there hoping that some one would find her,
and when it began to grow dark and nobody had
come she felt very lonely indeed.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">THE LOST DOLL.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall not close my eyes all night," she said; and
she did not. When the rooster over in the barnyard
crowed for morning, her eyes were as wide open as
they had been when the first star shone the evening
before.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as it was light again she heard a
noise in the meadow. Swish, swash! Swish, swash!
it sounded. The children's father was cutting his
grass with a sharp-bladed scythe, but the doll did not
know this and when the grass around her fell down in
a heap upon her she thought that the end of everything
had come.</p>

<p>"What in the world has happened?" she asked a
grasshopper who had been caught in the fall.</p>

<p>"That is just what I should like to know myself,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
he answered; and he struggled up to the sunshine
and never came back.</p>

<p>The children did not come to look again for the
doll that day, or the next, and she gave up all hope of
being found.</p>

<p>"They have gone to visit their grandparents," she
said. "I heard them talking about it. They have forgotten
me, and I shall never see them again."</p>

<p>That very afternoon, however, they came to the
meadow to help their father rake the grass, which the
sun by that time had dried into sweet-smelling hay.
They had been on a visit, sure enough, and as they
worked they talked of the things they had done while
they were away from home. The doll could hear
every word they said.</p>

<p>"I rode Grandpa's horse to water two times by
myself," said the little boy.</p>

<p>"I fed Grandma's chickens every day with corn,"
said the little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandpa plants corn in his fields," said the little
boy. "You don't have to rake corn."</p>

<p>"I like to rake hay," said the little girl; "and
Mamma says that I may find Jennie Bluebell when the
field is cleared."</p>

<p>Oh! how the china doll's heart leaped for joy when
she heard that; and&mdash;do you believe it?&mdash;the very
next minute the hay that covered her was raked aside
and there she lay right before the little girl's eyes!</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" the little girl cried; "here she is, my
precious doll. I was never so glad in all my life."</p>

<p>And Jennie Bluebell was glad too, though she did
not say a word. She only smiled.</p>

<h2><a name="LITTLE_DOG_AND_BIG_DOG" id="LITTLE_DOG_AND_BIG_DOG">LITTLE DOG AND BIG DOG</a></h2>


<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time there were two dogs who
were great friends. One of them was small
and one was large, and they were called
Little Dog and Big Dog all the days of their lives,
and had no other names.</p>

<p>Little Dog barked at everything he saw. He
barked at the cat and he barked at the kittens; he
barked at the cow and he barked at the calf; he
barked at his own shadow; and he even barked at the
moon in the sky with a "Bow-wow-wow!" and a
"Bow-wow-wow!"</p>

<p>Big Dog had a very loud bark, "Bow-wow! Bow-wow!"
but he barked only when he had something
to say. And everybody listened to him.</p>

<p>Now one day as the two dogs sat together in the
sunshine, Big Dog said to Little Dog:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, let us go to see our friend, the king."</p>

<p>Little Dog thought this was a splendid plan, and
they started at once.</p>

<p>Big Dog walked along the road with his tail curled
over his back, and his head held high. "There is no
need of haste," he said, but Little Dog thought there
must be.</p>

<p>"I shall get there first," he called, as he scampered
ahead, but presently he came back as fast as he had
gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Big Dog, Big Dog," he said, "we cannot go
to see the king."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Big Dog. "Has he gone
away from home?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about that," answered Little Dog,
who was almost out of breath, "but a little farther on
there is a great river, and we can never get across."</p>

<p>But Big Dog would not turn back. "I must see
this great river," he said, and he walked on as quietly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
as before. Little Dog followed him, and when they
came to the river Big Dog jumped in, splish! splash!
and began to swim.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait," cried Little Dog, but Big Dog only
answered, "Don't be afraid."</p>

<p>So in jumped Little Dog, splish! splash! too, for he
did not want to be left behind. He was terribly
frightened, but he paddled himself along with his four
feet just as he saw Big Dog doing, and when he was
safe across the river, which was not half so wide as
he had thought, he barked at it as if he had never
been afraid at all.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow-wow-wow! You cannot keep us from
the king," he said, and he was off and away before
Big Dog had shaken the water from his coat. But in
less time than it takes to tell it, Big Dog spied him
running back with his tail hanging down and his ears
drooping.</p>

<p>"Oh, Big Dog, Big Dog!" he cried. "We cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
go to see the king, for in the wood yonder there is a
bear, and she will eat us both for her supper. I heard
her say so myself."</p>

<p>Then Big Dog made haste to the wood, barking
loudly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bow-wow! Bow-wow! I am not afraid! I am
not afraid!" and when the bear heard him she ran to
her home as fast as she could.</p>

<p>"I can eat honey for my supper," she said; and the
two dogs saw no more of her.</p>

<p>Now by this time Little Dog had run so fast and
barked so much that he was tired. "I do not want to
go to see the king," he said; and he lay down in the
road and put his head between his two front paws.</p>

<p>But Big Dog said, "I smell a bone," and Little
Dog jumped up in a hurry again. Sniff! sniff!&mdash;where
could it be? The two dogs put their noses
close to the ground and followed the scent till they
came to the turn of the road; and there sat a charcoal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
burner eating his supper of bread and mutton chops
by his fire.</p>

<p>Little Dog wanted to run up and beg for something,
but Big Dog would not go with him. "It is
more polite to wait," he said; and he sat down on the
other side of the road. Little Dog sat down beside
him, and they waited and waited; but at last the man
finished his chops and threw the bones to the dogs,
which was just what Big Dog had hoped he would
do. Oh, how good they tasted!</p>

<p>"Where shall we sleep to-night?" asked Little
Dog, when he had eaten his share.</p>

<p>"Oh, never fear," answered Big Dog, "we will find
a place;" and when they had gone on their way they
very soon came to a house in the wood. The door
was open, and Big Dog put his head inside to see if
anybody was at home. Nobody lived there, however,
but a barn swallow, so the dogs went in and lay down
to rest on some hay in the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span></p>

<p>"We must be off early," said Big Dog; but when
they woke up next morning the door was fastened
tight; for the wind had blown by in the night and
slammed it into its place. When Big Dog saw this
he was in great distress.</p>

<p>"Oh, Little Dog! Little Dog!" he cried. "I fear
we can never go to see the king, for the door is closed,
and there is no one to open it."</p>

<p>"But we can go through the hole under the door,"
answered Little Dog; and when Big Dog looked,
there, sure enough, at the bottom of the door, where
a board had rotted away, was a hole just large enough
for a little dog to creep through. Little Dog put his
nose through and his head through, and then wriggle,
wriggle, he was out and barking merrily.</p>

<p>"Come on, Big Dog," he called; but Big Dog could
not go. He could not even get his head through the
hole.</p>

<p>"You must go on alone," he said to Little Dog,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
"and when you have come to the king's palace, and
have told him about me, perhaps he will send me aid."</p>

<p>But Little Dog did not wait until he reached the
king's palace to ask for help. "Bow-wow-wow-wow!
Listen to me," he barked, as he ran down the road.
"Big Dog, my friend, is shut up in the house in the
wood, and cannot go to see the king. Bow-wow-wow-wow!"</p>

<p>At first there were only birds to hear him, but presently
he saw a woodcutter with an axe on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Bow-wow-wow-wow! Listen to me," barked
Little Dog. "Big Dog, my friend, is shut up in the
house in the wood and cannot go to see the king.
Bow-wow-wow-wow!" But the woodcutter did not
understand a word he said.</p>

<p>"Whew! whew!" he whistled, which meant,
"Come, little doggie, follow me;" but Little Dog had
no time to play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span></p>

<p>He hurried on as fast as he could, and by and by
he met the woodcutter's wife going to town with a
basket of eggs on her arm. "Bow-wow-wow-wow!
Listen to me. Big Dog, my friend, is shut up in the
house in the wood, and cannot go to see the king,"
barked Little Dog. But the woodcutter's wife did
not understand a word he said.</p>

<p>"You noisy little dog," she cried. "You have
startled me so that it is a wonder every egg in my
basket is not broken," and she shook her skirts to
get rid of him.</p>

<p>"Nobody will listen to me," thought Little Dog,
as he scampered on, but just then he spied a little boy
with a bundle of sticks on his back. He was the woodcutter's
little boy; and&mdash;do you believe it?&mdash;he
understood every word that Little Dog said, and
followed him to the house.</p>

<p>When they drew near they heard Big Dog calling
for help:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Bow-wow! Bow-wow! Come and let me out.
Come and let me out."</p>

<p>"Bow-wow! we are coming," answered Little
Dog.</p>

<p>"We are coming," said the woodcutter's little boy;
and the very next minute Big Dog was free.</p>

<p>The king's palace was not far from the wood, and
the two dogs were soon at their journey's end. The
king was so pleased to see them that he made a great
feast for them, and invited the woodcutter's little boy
because he was their friend.</p>

<p>After the feast Big Dog and Little Dog were sent
home in the king's own carriage; and all the rest of
their lives they were even better friends than before
they went traveling together.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LITTLE_KINGS_RABBITS" id="THE_LITTLE_KINGS_RABBITS">THE LITTLE KING'S RABBITS</a></h2>


<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>ne morning when the little king waked up,
all of his pet rabbits were gone, and nobody,
not even the owl who had been awake all
night, knew anything about them. They were white
rabbits with pink eyes and pink ears, and you can just
imagine how the little king felt when he heard they
were lost.</p>

<p>"Find my white rabbits and I will give you whatever
you ask of me, even though it should be the
crown from my head," he said to everybody who
came to see him; and, of course, everybody started
out at once to look for the rabbits.</p>

<p>The princes and princesses, the dukes and the duchesses,
the counts and the countesses, and all the other
fine ladies and gentlemen of the king's court went in
carriages to the city to look for the rabbits, and presently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
they came back in great glee. They had not
found the rabbits, but they had bought some made of
candy at a confectioner's shop, and they were very
much pleased with themselves.</p>

<p>"These are so cunning and sweet&mdash;much sweeter
than real rabbits," they said, but the little king did
not think so.</p>

<p>"They are fit for nothing but to be eaten," he said,
and he had them carried away to the pantry.</p>

<p>The little king's soldiers felt very certain that the
king in the next country had taken away the rabbits,
so they marched over the hill to bring them back,
beating their drums with a bum, bum, bum. Their
uniforms were as red as a cock's comb, and they were
as brave as lions, but they had to come home without
the white rabbits. The king of the next country had
never so much as seen the tips of their ears.</p>

<p>"King indeed," said the hunters. "The foxes have
carried the rabbits away to their dens, and we will go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
and bring them back or know the reason why," and
they hastened to the woods with their guns. Bang,
bang&mdash;they, too, made a great noise, but it did no
good. The king's rabbits were nowhere to be
found.</p>

<p>The servants all went to the park. "If the rabbits
are anywhere they are here," they said, and they told
the park policeman about them.</p>

<p>"White rabbits with pink eyes and pink ears are
not allowed in the park," he said indignantly, so the
servants had to go home without the rabbits, as all
the rest had done.</p>

<p>The king's gardener went to his garden in a hurry.
"I'll not have a leaf left," he said to himself. But
when he got to the garden every leaf was in place.
The pink roses were just opening their buds in the
sunshine, and the white pinks were nodding in the
breezes, but not a sign of the white rabbits with pink
eyes and pink ears did the gardener see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span></p>

<p>The gardener's little daughter Peggy went to the
rabbit hutch first of all. She knew that the rabbits
were not there, of course, but she had to begin her
search somewhere. Nobody, not even the little king
himself, loved the white rabbits more than Peggy did.
She knew their names, and how old they were, and
what they liked best to eat. Every morning as soon
as she had eaten her own breakfast she came up from
the little cottage where she lived with her mother and
father, to bring them lettuce and cabbage leaves. It
made her very sad to see the empty hutch, and two
bright tears shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>Before they had time to roll down her cheeks
Peggy saw something that surprised her very much.
It was a hole in the corner of the fence that was built
around the rabbit hutch. As soon as she saw it she
dried her eyes, and ran through the gate into the road
behind the barnyard. The rabbits were not there,
but in the dust that lay thick and white along the
road were ever so many queer little marks that looked
like the prints of rabbit feet.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">THE LITTLE KING'S RABBITS.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, so this is the way they went," said Peggy,
and she followed the tracks as long as she could see
them.</p>

<p>By and by she came to a cool green lane that led
from one side of the road. That was the very place
for rabbits, Peggy thought.</p>

<p>"Bunny, bunny, bunny," she called as she peeped
in. Not a rabbit or a rabbit track was to be seen,
however, and Peggy was hurrying away when she
spied by the path a bunch of green clover all tattered
and torn, just as if&mdash;just as if&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rabbit teeth have been nibbling these leaves,"
cried Peggy joyfully, and she hastened down the lane
expecting to see the rabbits at every turn. But she
did not find them, though she looked behind every
tree, and into every nook and corner from one end of
the lane to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span></p>

<p>There were two roads at the other end of the lane.
One led over the hill to the next country. There were
many footprints upon it, but they were only the ones
the soldiers had left when they marched away to find
the white rabbits. The other road ran by the woods
where the hunters had hurried. Grass grew upon it,
and flowers nodded over it, but there was not a single
nibbled leaf to show that the rabbits had been there.</p>

<p>"Dear me, which way shall I go?" said Peggy;
but she had scarcely spoken when a breeze blew by.
It had been blowing over somebody's garden. Peggy
knew that as soon as it passed.</p>

<p>"I smell cabbages," she cried, and away she ran by
the woods, and through the flowers, till she came to
an old woman's cabbage patch. And there, eating
cabbage leaves to their hearts' content, sat the little
king's rabbits! Peggy ran home as fast as she had
come; and great was the rejoicing in the king's
palace when she had told her news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span></p>

<p>"I will give you whatever you ask, even should it
be the crown from my head," the little king said to
her; and all the fine ladies and gentlemen crowded
around to hear what she would say.</p>

<p>"A carriage and horses," whispered one.</p>

<p>"A bag of gold," said another.</p>

<p>"A house and land," cried a third, for they all
wanted to help her choose.</p>

<p>But Peggy knew what she wanted without anybody's
help.</p>

<p>"If you please, your majesty," she said, making
the king a curtsey, "I should like a white rabbit for
my own."</p>

<p>And&mdash;do you believe it?&mdash;the little king gave her
two!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SNOWMAN" id="THE_SNOWMAN">THE SNOWMAN</a></h2>


<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>nce upon a time there was a man who was
made of snow. He had sticks for his arms,
and coals for his eyes; his nose was made
of an icicle, and his mouth was a bit of bent twig,
which turned up at the ends, so he looked as if he
were smiling.</p>

<p>"He's the finest snowman we've ever seen," said
the children who made him; and they joined hands
and danced around him till their mother called them
in to supper.</p>

<p>"Good-by," they called to him as they climbed the
fence that divided the field from the yard. "Good-by.
We will bring you a hat to-morrow."</p>

<p>There were a half dozen of the children, and the
youngest of them was a little boy who had never
helped to make a snowman before. He thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
this one all the time he was eating his supper, and
even after he had gone to bed that night. He knew
just how the snowman looked with his smiling mouth
and stick arms.</p>

<p>"I wish we had taken him a hat to-night," he
thought, as his eyelids dropped down like two little
curtains over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Archoo! archoo! I wish that you had," said
something outside the window; and&mdash;do you believe
it?&mdash;it was the snowman sneezing as hard as
he could!</p>

<p>"This is what comes of standing out in the cold
bareheaded," he said. "I shall sneeze my head off&mdash;I
know I shall. Archoo! archoo! archoo!"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the little boy. "I will get you a
hat but it will have to be my sailor, for I wear my
new hat to church and to parties, and my everyday
cap will not fit you, I am afraid,&mdash;we made your
head so large."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span></p>

<p>"The sailor will do nicely," said the snowman, "if
I may have it at once. As it is, I am catching my
death of cold. Archoo! archoo! archoo!"</p>

<p>When the little boy heard this, he jumped out of
bed and ran to the cupboard and got the sailor hat
from the top shelf and gave it to the snowman.</p>

<p>"How do I look in it?" he asked as soon as he had
put it on.</p>

<p>"Well enough," answered the moon, who had
been watching all the while; "but you will have
to make haste if you want to go anywhere before
daylight."</p>

<p>"Don't you hear what the moon is saying?" said
the snowman to the little boy. "What are you waiting
for?"</p>

<p>"Am I going anywhere?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"Of course," answered the snowman. "Why
shouldn't you go?"</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 412px;">
<a id="fp86"></a><img src="images/fp86.png" width="412" height="483" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">THE SNOWMAN.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span></p>

<p>The little boy could not think of an answer to this;
and the next thing he knew he was out of the window
with the snowman.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Why," said the snowman hurrying away into the
street, "I have never thought of that, but since you
speak of it I think we had better go to the Winter
King's palace, and ask him if he cannot do something
to keep the sun from shining to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the little boy, for his mother had promised
that he might go to his grandmother's if the day
was fine. He had no time to say anything about this,
however, for just then the snowman cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have dropped one of my eyes, and I cannot go
on without it."</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me!" said the little boy. "How
shall we ever find it?"</p>

<p>But while he was talking, a little dog that he knew
very well came by. His name was Fido, and he could
find anything that was lost. He had found the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
ball when it rolled under the house, and his master's
overshoes when everybody else had failed; and when
he heard of the lost eye he started back at once to look
for it.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said the little boy, "Fido will find
it;" and sure enough, in the twinkle of a star he was
back with the coal in his mouth! The little boy put
it in its place as quickly as he could, for the snowman
seemed to be in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see that we were at a baker's shop?"
he said. "I know I must have been near the oven,
too, for one of my ears is almost melted off."</p>

<p>"Why, you haven't any ears!" said the little boy.
"We did not know how to make them."</p>

<p>"No ears?" cried the snowman. "Then how do
I hear what you say? But there now, you are only
a little boy, and cannot know everything. Besides,
here we are at the palace, and you must be quiet."</p>

<p>The little boy had thought he was passing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
schoolhouse where his big brothers and sisters went
to school, but when he went inside he saw that he
was wrong, and the snowman was right, for in the
place where the teacher's desk should have been, was
a throne; and on the throne sat the Winter King with
icicles in his beard.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw the snowman and the little boy,
he began to talk very fast:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What has this little boy been doing? Why isn't
he in bed? Come here, Jack Frost, and tickle his
toes."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no," cried the snowman. "He has done
nothing wrong. He is one of my best friends,
and I have brought him here with me to ask you
not to let the sun shine to-morrow. I don't want to
melt."</p>

<p>"Ah! hum! ha!" said the king. "I don't know
about that. You will have to melt sometime, won't
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," said the snowman; "but I'd like to
last as long as I can." It made the little boy very sad
to hear him talk in this way. He thought he would
rather not go to his grandmother's than to risk the
snowman in the sun.</p>

<p>"We are very fond of him," he said to the king.
"He's the finest snowman we've ever seen, and he
looks just as if he were smiling."</p>

<p>"So he does," said the king, looking at the snowman
again; "and since you ask it I'll tell you what
I will do. I cannot keep the sun from shining, but I
will ask the North Wind to freeze the snowman, and
perhaps he will last anyhow."</p>

<p>When the snowman heard this he began to dance,
and as the little boy had hold of one of his stick arms
he had to dance too. Together they danced out of
the Winter King's palace, down the streets, into the
field, where they found the North Wind waiting for
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing he did was to blow the hat from the
snowman's head.</p>

<p>"Archoo! archoo!" sneezed the snowman. "I
know I shall catch cold."</p>

<p>And "archoo!" sneezed the little boy; and he
sneezed so loud that he waked himself up, for&mdash;do
you believe it?&mdash;he had been asleep and dreaming
all the time!</p>

<p>One part of his dream came true, though, for when
he looked out of the window, the next morning, there
stood the snowman in the field frozen hard.</p>
